This condition is typically a sign of nutrient deficiency, especially of iron or zinc, which affects chlorophyll production. It may also indicate underlying soil issues such as poor drainage or imbalanced pH levels. If left untreated, banded chlorosis can reduce the plantâ€™s photosynthetic efficiency, leading to stunted growth and decreased sugarcane yield. Early detection through image-based models helps in timely corrective action and improves crop health.",
                                    "To prevent and manage Banded Chlorosis in sugarcane, it is important to ensure balanced soil nutrition and proper field management. Regular soil testing can help identify deficiencies, especially of micronutrients like iron and zinc. Applying appropriate fertilizers or foliar sprays containing these nutrients can effectively correct the condition. Improving soil drainage, avoiding waterlogging, and maintaining optimal pH levels also support nutrient uptake. Early detection through visual monitoring or automated disease detection models enables timely intervention, reducing the risk of long-term crop damage."

It appears as small, round to oval, reddish-brown pustules scattered mainly on the upper leaf surfaces. These pustules release spores that spread easily through wind and rain, leading to rapid infection under warm and humid conditions. Brown Rust reduces photosynthetic area and weakens the plant, which can result in lower sugar content and reduced cane yield if the infection is severe.",
                                    "To prevent and control Brown Rust, it is essential to use resistant sugarcane varieties and practice crop rotation to reduce fungal buildup in the soil. Fungicide applications during the early stages of infection can help limit disease spread. Maintaining good field sanitation by removing infected crop residues and controlling weeds also minimizes inoculum sources. Early detection through field scouting or automated disease detection systems allows timely treatment and protects overall crop health."

These spots often have a darker border and can cause the affected leaf tissue to dry out and die. The disease thrives in warm, humid environments and can spread rapidly, reducing the photosynthetic area of the leaves, which negatively impacts plant growth and sugar production.",

This symptom can be caused by factors such as drought, excessive heat, fungal infections, or lack of essential nutrients like potassium. Dried leaves reduce the plantâ€™s ability to perform photosynthesis effectively, leading to weakened growth and lower sugar yields.",
